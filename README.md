# ML_Clustering_Project_Cardiac_Arrest_Analysis
In this project i have used hierarchical clustering on the cardiac arrest data

Project Description:
In this particular project, we are using a dataset that contains information like quality Gender, Chain_smoker, Consumes_other_tobacco_products, HighBP, Obese, Diabetes, Metabolic_syndrome
However, before you go ahead and make clustering, it is advised that you first pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
In addition, try various tricks and techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in your predictions.
